<p><strong>How to navigate the dynamic PRASE report</strong></p>

<p>This on screen report will give you a detailed overview of patient feedback and their experiences of safety collected during their stay on your ward.</p>

<p>The “Summary Report” gives you an overview of the patient feedback, broken down into the patient safety domains.</p>

<p>Using a traffic light style of presentation, you can quickly see where you are doing well (green), and what areas may need further improvement (red). Ticks or exclamation marks show if there are positive or negative comments against a domain or question.</p>

<p>Clicking the tabs across the top titled the “General positive comments report” and the “General Concerns Report”, allows you to see the free text comments from your patients.</p>

<p>Going back to the “Summary Report” you will find the patient safety domains listed along the left of the traffic light graph. Please note that you may have to scroll the page down when you flip between tabs to be able to view the report section.</p>

<p>Clicking on each ‘domain’ will take you to the questions that are linked to the domain and the associated feedback comments. They are set out in the same format as the summary report, with the comment tabs above the graph leading you to the specific comments received from your patients.</p>

<p>Use the browser ‘back’ button to go back to the “Summary Report” and then chose another domain to explore.</p>

<p>The report can be printed off by clicking the ‘Download report’ button (top right of screen).</p>

<p>When reviewing the report we recommend that you:</br>
View the graph and comments together.</br>
Share the feedback with all your ward staff.</br>
Assemble a multidisciplinary team or share this at a multidisciplinary team meeting to consider this feedback, alongside other ward metrics/feedback, to plan any changes required to improve.</br>
