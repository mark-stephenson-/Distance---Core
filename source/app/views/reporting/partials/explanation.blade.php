<p><strong>How to use your PRASE report</strong></p>

<p>This PRASE report will give you a detailed overview of patient feedback and their experiences of safety collected during their stay on your ward.</p>

<p>The “Overview of the patient measures of safety” gives you an overview of the patient feedback, broken down into the patient safety domains.</p>

<p>Using a traffic light style of presentation, you can quickly see where you are doing well (green), and what areas may need further improvement (red).</p>

<p>Each ‘domain’ is reported in the same style, displaying the results from each question.  The positive comments and the concerns from your patients are included in each domain.</p>

<p>We recommend that you:
<br>View the graph and comments together. </br>
<br>Share the feedback with all your ward staff. </br>
<br>Assemble a multidisciplinary team or share this at a multidisciplinary team meeting to consider this feedback, alongside other ward metrics/feedback, to plan any changes required to improve.</br>
